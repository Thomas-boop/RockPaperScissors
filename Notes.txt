create a function that is called getcomputerchoice.
it must randomly generaten 


write a functions that plays a single round!
it must take two parameters named (playerSelection) and (computerSelectio)
it must return a string value that declares a winner
like for example "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"




Create three buttons, one for each selection.
Add an event listener to the buttons that call 
your playRound function with the correct playerSelection 
every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
